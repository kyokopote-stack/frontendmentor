## Overview

This challenge was quite advanced for me as a JavaScript beginner.  
I relied on AI for guidance, but by taking the time to understand each syntax and flow,  
I feel like I’ve taken a couple of real steps into the world of JavaScript.

There were many tricky parts, but the one that challenged me the most was handling the `active` state.  
It behaves differently from the CSS `:active`, and after some trial and error,  
I decided to delay the toggle slightly for a smoother interaction.  
I’m looking forward to checking how other developers approached this part.
