## 🛠️ My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)
- Responsive design (using relative units and consistent spacing)

---

### What I learned

I focused on recreating the list layout to match the design as closely as possible.  
It took some trial and error to get the spacing and bullet alignment right,  
but I learned a lot about how lists behave in CSS.

---

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my ability to reproduce precise designs,  
especially when using Grid layouts and pseudo-elements for decoration.

---

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) – Great reference for CSS Grid and pseudo-elements.
- [Frontend Mentor community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) – Helpful place to share and get feedback.
