## 🛠️ My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive layout using `clamp()` (no media queries)
- Semantic HTML

---

### What I learned

I’m proud that I made the card display in the center of the screen, based on my reflections from the previous challenge.  
I also managed to code without using media queries, which helped me understand how flexible the `clamp()` function can be.

---

### Continued development

I’d like to keep improving my semantic HTML structure and practice accessibility,  
so visitors can easily navigate the site with only their keyboard.
