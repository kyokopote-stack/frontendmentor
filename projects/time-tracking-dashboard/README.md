## Overview

This challenge was my first time working with JSON data.
It was something I’d been wanting to try, so I found it really interesting!
I still have a lot to learn about JavaScript, but I’m enjoying the process and having fun studying it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### What I learned

I learned how to work with JSON data.
I got a better understanding of how JavaScript flows.
I also learned a bit about how to structure HTML when using JavaScript.

### Continued development

I’d like to keep improving my understanding of JavaScript.
I also want to learn how to write cleaner, more efficient code.
Working with data and animations was really fun, so I’d like to explore more projects like this.
