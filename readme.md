# 🧠 Frontend Mentor Challenges by Kyokopote

This repository is a collection of my completed [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.  
Each project has its own folder inside the `/projects` directory.  
Through these challenges, I'm practicing HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript step by step 💪

## 🪴 About This Repository

This is my archive of Frontend Mentor projects.  
I started it to keep my learning journey in one place and track my progress over time.

Each folder includes:

- `index.html`
- `style.css` or `scss/`
- `js/`
- any assets like `images/` or `data.json`

---

## 🧠 What I'm Currently Learning

- Writing cleaner, reusable JavaScript (JSON, fetch, and DOM manipulation)
- Responsive design using Grid and Flexbox
- Accessibility and semantic HTML
